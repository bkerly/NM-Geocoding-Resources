# NM Geocoding Resources

This is a quick little script and workflow designed to help classify addresses as homes, businesses, or whatever.

It's based around BING queries, which I don't know if they work anymore.

But basically the R script takes addresses as an input and returns a plain text of the search results as an output in a csv or whatever, and then you just `CTRL+F` through those.
